          During our oral care outreach, We discovered AMEEN ABDULRAHMAN is in need of dental attention.
          A dentist who visited the school recommended him to have 3 teeth removed to prevent an overbite. 
          If this is not done, he will likely need braces later, which would incur a cost of approximately 1.5 MILLION NAIRA. 
          The Grace Life Foundation is offering to sponsor this treatment with Yusjib Hospital's partnership 
          to address the issue promptly and avoid further complications.
