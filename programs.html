          During our oral care outreach, We discovered AMEEN ABDULRAHMAN is in need of dental attention.
          A dentist who visited the school recommended him to have 3 teeth removed to prevent an overbite. 
          If this is not done, he will likely need braces later, which would incur a cost of approximately 1.5 MILLION NAIRA. 
          The Grace Life Foundation is offering to sponsor this treatment with Yusjib Hospital's partnership 
          to address the issue promptly and avoid further complications.

          Our recent outreach on Female Genital Mutilation was an eye-opening and impactful experience. The session brought together community members to learn about the dangers of FGM and the importance of protecting the rights and health of girls.
        </p>
        <p>
          Participants engaged actively, shared personal thoughts, and asked important questions about culture, health, and education. Many expressed a clearer understanding of how harmful FGM is and why it must be stopped.
        </p>
        <p>
          The team from Grace Life Foundation emphasized that ending FGM starts with awareness and collective responsibility. We encouraged everyone to speak out, educate others, and support survivors with compassion.

        <p>
          We're grateful to the community leaders who welcomed us and made this campaign a success. Together, we're building a safer future for every girl with
