          WASTE: Discarded plastics end up on streets and in waterways. <br>
          PARTICLES: Sunlight and wear break plastics into microplastics and nanoplastics. <br>
          EXPOSURE: These tiny particles enter our bodies through air, water, and food. <br>
          HEALTH: Linked to inflammation, organ damage, and unknown long-term effects. <br>
          POLICY: Strong policies can stop the cycle by reducing plastic use and improving waste management. <br>
          Plastic waste → Microplastics → Human health <br>
          Plastic pollution is a public-health issue. Clean environment protect public health, and strong policies can stop this cycle.

      <h2>Nigeria is missing from Microplastics conversation</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="program-text">
      <p>
        Nigeria is largely missing from the global microplastics conversation.
        Not because exposure is low, but because data is absent. <br>
        Most microplastics research focuses on Europe, North America, and parts of Asia. 
        West Africa barely appears in baseline datasets. That gap matters. Especially when microplastics
        are now framed as a public health issue, not only an environmental one. <br>
        At Grace Life Foundation For Social Impacts, we are trying to understand a simple question. 
        What does the lack of Nigerian microplastics data mean for health policy, risk assessment, and global models? <br>
        Right now, our work is exploratory, Mapping gaps, learning from existing resarch, Listening to scientists who have conducted this work rigorously. <br>
        If you are a researcher, practitoner, or institution working on microplastics in Nigeria, exposure scientists, or environmental health, we would value your perspective.
        Especially on what responsible first steps should look like in a low data setting in Nigeria. <br>

        Clean water does not mean safe water! This water looks calm,
        but would you bet your health on it?. Microplastics don't
        announce themselves. They sit in water, food and bodies.
        Nigeria has no local data on this. What should we be measuring first?

        <p>
          Plastic pollution is often still treated as something we see simply floating in our oceans. The plastics causing the most pervasive harm do not float, they are the insidious, microscopic particles that infiltrate every part of our environment. They wear off tyres and brake pads on our roads. 
          They flake from road markings and infrastructure. They settle into the air we breathe and the water we drink. Current regulation typically pursues the easy, visible targets: straws, bags, and large, visible waste.
          Meanwhile, these smallest particles: microplastics and nanoplastics move through gaps that policy has yet to fully reach. This is not a loud, visible crisis, it is a quiet, systemic one. It is a shared challenge that cuts across science, public health, transport, and environmental regulation.
          For those working in research, public health, policy development, or environmental action, this is a space we must tackle collaboratively. The problem is shared, and the comprehensive response must be too. 
          The visible pollution in the picture is the feedstock for the invisible pollution that constitutes the more pervasive, systemic harm.
          To truly address the quiet crisis, we must clean up and prevent piles!!!

        LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHING. If a fisherman pulls up his net and it's heavy, 
        but there's no fish inside, what do you think he caught? That “weight” is 
        plastic we used once and forgot! Sachet water, bottles, wrappers. Broken 
        down so small you can't see them, but big enough to stay in our bodies. He goes home… cooks, eats and feeds his family. The net looks empty, The plates aren’t. This is how microplastics move! Not with noise!! With routine!!! 
        Do you think this is already part of daily life, or do you think we still have time to stop it?

        Microplastics are already inside us. In our water. Our food. Our air.
        Nigeria feels this reality every day.
        With a large population, heavy plastic use, informal waste systems, 
        and diverse ecosystems, Nigeria shows the full picture of microplastic exposure in 
        real life, not in controlled labs. Yet the country remains under-studied.
        This gap is a missed opportunity. For researchers and innovators, Nigeria 
        offers scale, urgency, and conditions where findings can shape health outcomes and policy.
        At Grace Life Foundation For Social Impacts, we are opening doors for serious 
        collaboration. Field research, Community access, Pilot solutions. Policy-focused work that goes beyond papers. This is not charity work. It is meaningful science, where impact is immediate. If you want research that matters, Nigeria is ready.

          Nigeria eats, drinks, and breathes plastic every day, often without knowing it. 
          Microplastics are already inside our bodies. In our water. Our food. Even the air we inhale.
          This is no longer an environmental issue alone. It is a public health problem. 
          Plastics break down. They do not disappear. They enter rivers, farms, and markets. From there, they enter you.
          Waiting costs more. Health risks grow. Clean-up becomes harder. 
          We can still reduce the damage. We can change waste habits. 
          We can demand accountability. We can protect our communities. Act now. Before the damage becomes permanent.

            The stream in this part of Ilorin is filled with plastic waste and stagnant runoff. People live beside it and breathe it every day. A major tobacco company operates close 
            to this corridor, yet the surrounding environment remains in this state. 
            Government agencies also see this location and nothing changes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Industries working here should support real cleanup efforts and invest in community health. Government must 
            enforce proper waste control and protect the residents who depend on this area. Public health should not be ignored. 
            Kwara State deserves leaders and companies that act, not look away.

            Clean water is a fundamental human right. Protecting our waterways from this 
            deluge of waste is not a choice, it is a moral imperative.
